# Scenario: Editing a widget
# Given there is a canvas
# And that canvas has a question widget
# And I am authenticated
# And I am a member of that canvas
# And I am on that canvas' homepage
# And I wait until all Ajax requests are complete
# And test
# # When I follow "edit" within "#feed"
# # And I fill in "widget_question" with "what?" within "#feed"
# # And I press "widget_submit" within "#feed"
# # Then reload the page
# # And vomit the page
# 
# 
# 
# # And I wait 20 seconds
# # Then vomit the page
# # Then the ".question" should contain "what?"
